Here's an overview of how different epistemological frameworks might approach the question of whether the external world exists and how they would justify or not justify the proposition:

Rationalism: Rationalists would argue that knowledge about the external world can be obtained through reason and logical analysis. They might posit that certain innate ideas or principles allow us to deduce the existence of the external world. The justification would rely on the power of rational thought and the coherence of logical arguments.

Empiricism: Empiricists would emphasize the role of sensory experience in acquiring knowledge. They would argue that our perception of the external world through our senses provides evidence for its existence. Empiricists might require empirical evidence or direct observation to justify the proposition.

Skepticism: Skeptics would take a cautious stance and question the certainty of knowledge about the external world. They might argue that we cannot have absolute certainty regarding the existence of the external world due to the limitations of human perception and the possibility of deception. Skeptics might find it challenging to provide a definitive justification for or against the proposition.

Idealism: Idealists would propose that reality is fundamentally mental or based on consciousness. They might argue that the external world is a construct of the mind and does not have an independent existence. Idealists might not justify the proposition of the external world's existence in the way it is commonly understood.

Realism: Philosophical realists would affirm the existence of the external world as an independent reality. They would argue that our perceptions and experiences correspond to an external reality that exists regardless of our subjective interpretations. Realists might justify the proposition by emphasizing the coherence and consistency of our experiences and the success of scientific inquiry.

Pragmatism: Pragmatists would focus on the practical consequences and usefulness of believing in the existence of the external world. They might argue that accepting the external world as real allows us to navigate and interact with our environment effectively. Pragmatists might justify the proposition based on its pragmatic value rather than providing a definitive proof.

It's important to note that these are simplified explanations, and different philosophers within each framework may have nuanced variations in their approaches. Additionally, individual perspectives may differ within each framework. Epistemological frameworks provide different lenses through which philosophers analyze knowledge and reality, and the question of the external world's existence is a complex and ongoing philosophical inquiry
